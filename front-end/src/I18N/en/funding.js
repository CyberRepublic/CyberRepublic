    title: `Adding a funding Suggestion to Cyber Republic`,
    p1: `As the Elastos ecosystem DAO, Cyber Republic (CR) supports Elastos' third tier of consensus via a unique proposal model. CR is headed by a 12-party council that is elected annually by ELA tokenholders, but everyone in the Elastos ecosystem is eligible and encouraged to participate in the proposal process.`,
    p2: `Although community members cannot submit a proposal directly, they may submit prospective drafts called suggestions. When a suggestion picks up traction in the community, a council member may nominate the suggestion and transition it to a proposal. At this stage, the entire CR Council votes on the proposal to determine whether to carry out its contents and disburse the requested funding allocations.`,
